# Deep learning for drug NER on death certificates

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook with code for developing a deep learning model for recognizing drugs on death certificates.
To use this code, data must be pre-split into train, validation, and test sets. The format for the files required by the Flair libray is available in Flair documentation, https://github.com/flairNLP/flair.
